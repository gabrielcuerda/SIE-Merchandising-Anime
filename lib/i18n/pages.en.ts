<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>We are a small team of fans who started buying figures for our own collections and ended up importing them for other collectors. We do not sell second-hand items or replicas: everything that leaves our warehouse is original and factory sealed.</p>

<h2>What we sell</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action figures</strong>: 8 to 30 cm tall, with the original box and all accessories.</li>
<li><strong>Manga and volumes</strong>: in Japanese, single volumes or complete sets.</li>
<li><strong>Apparel</strong>: t-shirts, hoodies and socks with official designs.</li>
<li><strong>Collectibles</strong>: pins, coasters, cards and limited-edition figures.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we work</h2>
<ol>
<li>We buy directly from Japanese distributors, with no middlemen.</li>
<li>We check the condition and packaging of every piece before packing it.</li>
<li>We ship from our warehouse in Madrid, usually within 24-48 working hours.</li>
<li>We reply by email before and after your order.</li>
